## Documentation
RESTful API Design: Designed endpoints using proper HTTP methods and clear URI structures.

Mock Data: Created sample data for testing instead of using a real database.

Error Handling: Implemented a middleware system to manage errors efficiently.

## Reflection
I Learned how to design and build a well-structured API using Express.js and understood the importance of middleware for handling security, logging, and errors plus i gained experience in managing API responses based on different client needs. but i didn't learn all because we were just copying from the screen and unstruction were already given.

And the challanges i had faced is 🥲 i cant run start the server. help me miss 🥲🥲🥲
